# exercises for week 20: SSCP domain 3

Exercise 1 is done individually, in pairs or groups - as you wish :-)

## Exercise/work 1: 1-1Â½ hours
1. Browser chapter 5
2. Go through the quiz at the end of the chapter
3. Make a [kahoot](https://kahoot.com) with at least 5 questions

## Exercise 2:
Domain 3 is all about risks, and risk without context doesn't make sense. We will use the ITS project as context.

1. Locate some risks
    * As described in NIST SP 800-30, we have 3 tiers: organisational, mission/business and information system
    * Decide on 1-2 risks on each tier related to the ITS project.
    * The risks must be substatial, relevant and in context
2. Do the risk assessment
    * Chapter 5 outlines an analytical way of calculating risks, this is applicable to some risks
    * Other risk is more qualitatively decided, since no real data may support a qunatitavtive analysis
3. Decide on an appropriate action: 
    * accept, mitigate, avoid, share, transfer
    * chapter 5 uses "reduce" as both "share" and "mitigate"
4. Describe how to implement it into the system
    * Do include an estimated resource cost
