## Schedule

### Preparation
* Work with chapter 7 in the SSCP book (1 hrs, K3)

### Thursday:
* 8.15-8:45 Recap of pasts weeks (K1)
  * A word on "Authoritative sources"
  * What have we been doing?
* 8.45-9:30 Crypto status (K2)
  * Make a list of examples of where you encounter crypto.
    * both as a user and as an admin
    * aim for interessting examples
  * Which crypto is used? How to find tell?
  * 5 slides/no text
* 9:30-10:00 Discussion on class (K1)
  * We will probably not go though all examples
* 10:00-11:00 Group work (K2)
  * Segment A: read the chapter and make a kahoot about it.
  * Segment B: Look into HSM (hardware security module), TPM (trusted platform module) and hardware accelerated crypto.
    * What is it? Do you have/use it? does juniper have it/support it? How to tell?
    * How does this affect keys, algorithms and such?    
* 11:00-11:15 Presentation from segment B (K1)
  * Remember your audience and purpose
* 11:15-11:45 Crypto in the ITS project (K2)
  * Where are we using crypto? where are we not using crypto? How tell?
  * Are we using the right crypto? are we only allowing the right crypto? How to tell?
* 12:15-13:00 Presenting or discussing plans (K1)
  * You have considered the crypto used in the ITS project
  * We need a plan on how to ensure that crypto is current, relevant and properly implemented.
    * How to do that?

### Friday:
* 8.15-9:00 Kahoots on Domain 5 (K1)
  * includes discussion on incidents and incident handling
* 9:00-10:00 Student presentations (K4)
  * Following [the schedule](https://fronter.com/eal/links/files.phtml/1261825527$31048836$/2nd+Semester/IT+Security/ITT2+ITS+presentations.pdf), we have 4-5 presentations
* 10:00-11:45 You-time (K4)
  * MON is available to see presentations, help in general or whatever else you find appropriate
    * ITS takes precedence, but I'll help as I can with whatever you bring
  * If there are no questions or activities, I'll leave early

### Consolidating work
* Implement the crypto as planned in the ITS system (4 hrs, K3)
  * If this is a proof-of-concept solution, we will discuss implementation Friday

## Goals of the week(s)
Pratical and learning goals for the period is as follows

### Practical goals
* None

### Learning goals
* SSCP domain 5: Cryptography
  * The student can explain the common concepts used in cryptography
  * The student can select and implement cryptographic algorithms related to a specific system
  * The student can detect and implement cryptography using relevant tool as part of the general security effort

## Deliverable/schedule
