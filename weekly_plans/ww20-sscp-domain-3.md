## Comments

* We have already discussed NIST special publications in [week 4](ww04-introduction.md) and [week 5](ww05-risk-assessments.md)
  * NIST SP800-39 is the one with the three tiers
  * NIST SP800-30 is the one where I found figure 3 to be really important, and you will notice that the concepts reappear in the SSCP chapter.
